# Naughts and Cosses with and without AI

## What is it??
Tic-tac-toe (American English) or noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. 

## My Solution
- I have implemented Naughts and Crosses both in using AI in the server and also without AI. Both of those approach is described in their respective foders.
