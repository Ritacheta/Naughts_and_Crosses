# Naughts and Cosses with and without AI

## What is it??
Tic-tac-toe (American English) or noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. 

## My Solution
- I have implemented Naughts and Crosses both in using AI in the server and also without AI. Both of those approach is described in their respective foders.

## Prerequisites
- The whole is written in **Python 3.8.5**. For installing python3 in your linux system, use this command in the terminal:
   - sudo apt install python3.8.5
- I have used **pygame** gui for creating the tic-tac-toe board and displaying the all things. Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. 
   -Installation
      python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
      To see if it works, run one of the included examples:
      python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
      If it works, you are ready to go! If not there are more detailed, head over the given link:https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
   -How to use:

      Every point is described there in a detailed way
