# Tic-Tac-Tac without using Artificial Intelligence

## Description
It is a multiserver-client GUI based tic-tac-toe implementation. I have used pygame for the whole code. 

**Pygame**
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. 

## My steps to make it innovative
- As **recv()** has a blocking nature, I have implemented a function for recieving data  to avoid that blocking.
- I have implemented an initial screen and also a text bar that shows who's turn is now and also the player.
- I have made the interface more attracting
